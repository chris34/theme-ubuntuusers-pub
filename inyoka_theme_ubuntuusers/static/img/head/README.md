SVGs were created with the following steps:

 1. create basic trianglify with HTML, save it as SVG
 2. create a 'mask' for the 'wave'
 3. apply the mask to the background. In Inkscape: Select both mask and background, then find in the menu Object → Clip → Set

So if you want to edit either background or mask, first release both (with Inkscape via Object → Clip → Release). Now you can edit them. Only thing to remember before setting the clip again is that the mask has to be on top of the background.
